        "## Phasor properties\n\nThe phasor is a frequency-domain representation of the fluorescence\nlifetime at a single frequency. For single-exponential lifetimes, this\ncompletely describes the system.\nFor multiple exponentials, the phasor represents some intensity-weighted\nlinear combination of the lifetimes in the system. Therefore, given the\nphasor for a single multiexponential measurement, we cannot determine\nthe lifetimes for the system.\nNevertheless, given multiple measurements (for example, multiple pixels in\nan image), heterogeneity becomes obvious.\n\nTo demonstrate this effect, calculate:\n\n- the phasor at a single frequency for a combination of four exponentials:\n\n"
