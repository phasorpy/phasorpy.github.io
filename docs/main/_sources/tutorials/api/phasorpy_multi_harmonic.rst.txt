Multi-harmonic phasor coordinates
=================================

An introduction to handling multi-harmonic phasor coordinates.

This tutorial is an adaptation of
:ref:`sphx_glr_tutorials_phasorpy_introduction.py`, focusing on the
calculation, calibration, filtering, thresholding, storage, and visualization
of multi-harmonic phasor coordinates.

Read signal from file
---------------------

Read a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) histogram with
56 time bins, acquired at 80.11 MHz, from a file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-42

.. code-block:: Python


    signal = signal_from_imspector_tiff(fetch('Embryo.tif'))
    frequency = signal.attrs['frequency']

    print(signal.shape)

Calculate phasor coordinates
----------------------------

Phasor coordinates at multiple harmonics can be calculated at once
from the signal. The histogram bins are in the first dimension of
the signal (`axis=0`).
Calculate all possible harmonics by specifying `harmonic='all'`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-53

.. code-block:: Python


    mean, real, imag = phasor_from_signal(signal, harmonic='all', axis=0)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-56

There are 28 (56/2) harmonics in the first dimension of the phasor
coordinates, `real` and `imag`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 56-66

.. code-block:: Python


    print(mean.shape, real.shape, imag.shape)

    # For the remainder of the tutorial, only the first and second harmonics
    # are used. They are calculated by specifying `harmonic=[1, 2]`:

    mean, real, imag = phasor_from_signal(signal, harmonic=[1, 2], axis=0)

    print(mean.shape, real.shape, imag.shape)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-79

Calibrate phasor coordinates
----------------------------

A homogeneous solution of Fluorescein with a fluorescence lifetime of 4.2 ns
was imaged as a reference for calibration:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-83

.. code-block:: Python


    reference_signal = signal_from_imspector_tiff(fetch('Fluorescein_Embryo.tif'))
    assert reference_signal.attrs['frequency'] == frequency








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-86

Calculate phasor coordinates from the measured reference signal at
the first and second harmonics:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 86-91

.. code-block:: Python


    reference_mean, reference_real, reference_imag = phasor_from_signal(
        reference_signal, harmonic=[1, 2], axis=0
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 92-95

Calibration can be performed at multiple harmonics simultaneously.
Calibrate the raw phasor coordinates with the reference coordinates
of known lifetime (4.2 ns), at the first and second harmonics:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-107

.. code-block:: Python


    real, imag = phasor_calibrate(
        real,
        imag,
        reference_mean,
        reference_real,
        reference_imag,
        frequency=frequency,
        harmonic=[1, 2],
        lifetime=4.2,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 108-110

If necessary, the calibration can be undone/reversed using the
same reference:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-130

.. code-block:: Python


    uncalibrated_real, uncalibrated_imag = phasor_calibrate(
        real,
        imag,
        reference_mean,
        reference_real,
        reference_imag,
        frequency=frequency,
        harmonic=[1, 2],
        lifetime=4.2,
        reverse=True,
    )

    assert numpy.allclose(
        (uncalibrated_real, uncalibrated_imag),
        phasor_from_signal(signal, harmonic=[1, 2], axis=0)[1:],
        atol=1e-3,
        equal_nan=True,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 131-138

Filter phasor coordinates
-------------------------

Applying a median filter to the calibrated phasor coordinates,
often multiple times, improves contrast and reduces noise.
The filter is applied independently to the real and imaginary components
of the harmonics, but not to the average signal:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 138-141

.. code-block:: Python


    mean, real, imag = phasor_filter_median(mean, real, imag, size=3, repeat=2)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 142-144

Pixels with low intensities are commonly excluded from analysis and
visualization of phasor coordinates:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 144-147

.. code-block:: Python


    mean, real, imag = phasor_threshold(mean, real, imag, mean_min=1)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 148-149

Show the calibrated, filtered phasor coordinates:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 149-154

.. code-block:: Python


    plot_phasor_image(
        mean, real, imag, title='Calibrated, filtered phasor coordinates'
    )

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 155-160

Store phasor coordinates
------------------------

Write the calibrated and filtered phasor coordinates at multiple harmonics
and the fundamental frequency to an OME-TIFF file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 160-174

.. code-block:: Python


    phasor_to_ometiff(
        'phasors.ome.tif',
        mean,
        real,
        imag,
        frequency=frequency,
        harmonic=[1, 2],  # real and imag contain 1st and 2nd harmonics
        description=(
            'Phasor coordinates at first and second harmonics of a zebrafish '
            'embryo at day 3, calibrated, median-filtered, and thresholded.'
        ),
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 175-176

Read the phasor coordinates and metadata back from the OME-TIFF file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 176-190

.. code-block:: Python


    mean_, real_, imag_, attrs = phasor_from_ometiff(
        'phasors.ome.tif',
        harmonic='all',  # read all harmonics stored in the file
    )

    assert numpy.allclose(real_, real, atol=1e-3, equal_nan=True)
    assert real_.dtype == numpy.float32
    assert attrs['frequency'] == frequency
    assert attrs['harmonic'] == [1, 2]  # the file contains only two harmonics
    assert attrs['description'].startswith(
        'Phasor coordinates at first and second harmonics'
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-196

Plot phasor coordinates
-----------------------

Visualize the two-dimensional histogram of the calibrated and filtered
phasor coordinates at the second harmonic:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 196-204

.. code-block:: Python


    plot_phasor(
        real[1],
        imag[1],
        frequency=frequency,
        title='Calibrated, filtered phasor coordinates at second harmonic',
    )

        uncalibrated_real[1],
