Introduction to PhasorPy
========================

An introduction to using the PhasorPy library.

PhasorPy is an open-source Python library for the analysis of fluorescence
lifetime and hyperspectral images using the :doc:`/phasor_approach`.

Using the PhasorPy library requires familiarity with the phasor approach,
image processing, array programming, and Python.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-52

Install Python
--------------

An installation of Python version 3.10 or higher is required to use the
PhasorPy library.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
Python installers can be obtained from, for example,
`Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or
`Anaconda.com <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Refer to the `Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_
for an introduction to Python.

Install PhasorPy
----------------

To download and install the PhasorPy library and all its dependencies from
the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/phasorpy/>`_ (PyPI),
run the following command on a command prompt, shell, or terminal::

    python -m pip install -U "phasorpy[all]"

Alternatively, PhasorPy can be installed via
`conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/phasorpy>`_ in an Anaconda
environment::

   conda install conda-forge::phasorpy

The development version of PhasorPy can be installed instead from the
latest source code on GitHub. This requires a C compiler, such as
XCode, Visual Studio, or gcc, to be installed::

    python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/phasorpy/phasorpy.git

Update optional dependencies as needed::

    python -m pip install -U lfdfiles sdtfile ptufile

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-59

Import phasorpy
---------------

Start the Python interpreter, import the ``phasorpy`` package,
and print its version:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-64

.. code-block:: Python


    import phasorpy

    print(phasorpy.__version__)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-67

Besides the PhasorPy library, the `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ library
is used for array computing throughout this tutorial:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 67-70

.. code-block:: Python


    import numpy








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 71-88

Read signal from file
---------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.io` module provides functions to read time-resolved
and hyperspectral image stacks and metadata from many file formats used
in microscopy, for example PicoQuant PTU, OME-TIFF, Zeiss LSM, and files
written by SimFCS software.
However, any other means that yields image stacks in numpy-array compatible
form can be used instead.
Image stacks, which may have any number of dimensions, are referred to as
``signal`` in the PhasorPy library.

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.datasets` module provides access to various sample
files. For example, an ImSpector TIFF file from the
`FLUTE <https://zenodo.org/records/8046636>`_  project containing a
time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) histogram
of a zebrafish embryo at day 3, acquired at 80.11 MHz:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-122

Calculate phasor coordinates
----------------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.phasor` module provides functions to calculate,
calibrate, filter, and convert phasor coordinates.

Phasor coordinates are the real and imaginary components of the complex
numbers returned by a real forward Digital Fourier Transform (DFT)
of a signal at certain harmonics (multiples of the fundamental frequency),
normalized by the mean intensity (the zeroth harmonic).
Phasor coordinates are named ``real`` and ``imag`` in the PhasorPy library.
In literature and other software, they are also known as
:math:`G` and :math:`S` or :math:`a` and :math:`b` (as in :math:`a + bi`).

Phasor coordinates of the first harmonic are calculated from the signal
over the axis containing the TCSPC histogram bins (`axis='H'` or `axis=0`):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-127

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.phasor import phasor_from_signal

    mean, real, imag = phasor_from_signal(signal, axis='H')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 128-131

The phasor coordinates are undefined if the mean intensity is zero.
In that case, the arrays contain special ``NaN`` (Not a Number) values,
which are ignored in further analysis:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 131-134

.. code-block:: Python


    print(real[:4, :4])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 135-136

Plot the calculated phasor coordinates:

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 142-145

By default, only the phasor coordinates at the first harmonic are calculated.
However, only when the phasor coordinates at all harmonics are considered
(including the mean intensity) is the signal completely described:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 145-157

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.phasor import phasor_to_signal

    phasor_all_harmonics = phasor_from_signal(signal, axis=0, harmonic='all')
    reconstructed_signal = phasor_to_signal(
        *phasor_all_harmonics, axis=0, samples=signal.shape[0]
    )

    numpy.testing.assert_allclose(
        numpy.nan_to_num(reconstructed_signal), signal, atol=1e-3
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 158-172

Calibrate phasor coordinates
----------------------------

The signals from time-resolved measurements are convoluted with an
instrument response function, causing the phasor-coordinates to be
phase-shifted and modulated (scaled) by unknown amounts.
The phasor coordinates must therefore be calibrated with coordinates
obtained from a reference standard of known lifetime, acquired with
the same instrument settings.

In this case, a homogeneous solution of Fluorescein with a lifetime of
4.2 ns was imaged.

Read the signal of the reference measurement from a file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-176

.. code-block:: Python


    reference_signal = signal_from_imspector_tiff(fetch('Fluorescein_Embryo.tif'))
    assert reference_signal.attrs['frequency'] == frequency








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 177-178

Calculate phasor coordinates from the measured reference signal:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 178-183

.. code-block:: Python

        reference_signal, axis=0
    )

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 212-217

The phasor coordinates are now located in the first quadrant, except for
some with low signal to noise level.

If necessary, the calibration can be undone/reversed using the
same reference:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 217-235

.. code-block:: Python


    uncalibrated_real, uncalibrated_imag = phasor_calibrate(
        real,

        reference_real,
        reference_imag,
        frequency=frequency,
        lifetime=4.2,
        reverse=True,
    )

    numpy.testing.assert_allclose(
        (mean, uncalibrated_real, uncalibrated_imag),
        phasor_from_signal(signal, axis=0),
        atol=1e-3,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 236-243

Filter phasor coordinates
-------------------------

Applying median filter to the calibrated phasor coordinates,
often multiple times, improves contrast and reduces noise.
The filter is applied independently to the real and imaginary components,
but not to the signal average:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 243-248

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.phasor import phasor_filter_median

    mean, real, imag = phasor_filter_median(mean, real, imag, size=3, repeat=2)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 249-251

Pixels with low intensities are commonly excluded from analysis and
visualization of phasor coordinates:

Store phasor coordinates
------------------------

Phasor coordinates and select metadata can be exported to
`OME-TIFF <https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ome-tiff/>`_
formatted files, which are compatible with Bio-Formats and Fiji.

Write the calibrated and filtered phasor coordinates, and frequency to an
OME-TIFF file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 273-289

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.io import phasor_from_ometiff, phasor_to_ometiff

    phasor_to_ometiff(

        harmonic=1,
        description=(
            'Phasor coordinates of a zebrafish embryo at day 3, '
            'calibrated, median-filtered, and thresholded.'
        ),
    )

    assert attrs['frequency'] == frequency
    assert attrs['harmonic'] == 1
    assert attrs['description'].startswith('Phasor coordinates of')








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 301-303

These functions also work transparently with multi-harmonic phasor
coordinates.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 305-313

Plot phasor coordinates
-----------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.plot` module provides functions and classes for
plotting phasor and polar coordinates.

Large number of phasor coordinates, such as obtained from imaging,
are commonly visualized as two-dimensional histograms:

The calibrated phasor coordinates of all pixels lie inside the universal
semicircle (on which theoretically the phasor coordinates of all single
exponential lifetimes are located).
That means, all pixels contain mixtures of signals from multiple lifetime
components.

Select phasor coordinates
-------------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.cursors` module provides functions for selecting phasor
coordinates to define and mask regions of interest within the phasor space.

Mask regions of interest in the phasor space using circular cursors:

Phasor coordinates can be calculated from hyperspectral images (acquired
at many equidistant emission wavelengths) and processed in much the same
way as time-resolved signals. Calibration is not necessary.
