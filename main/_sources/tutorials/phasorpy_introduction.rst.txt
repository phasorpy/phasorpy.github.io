Introduction
============

This tutorial provides an introduction to using the PhasorPy library.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 10-29

Install Python
--------------

An installation of Python version 3.10 or higher is required to use the
PhasorPy library.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
Python installers can be obtained from, for example,
`Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or
`Anaconda.com <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Refer to the `Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_
for an introduction to Python.

Install PhasorPy
----------------

On a command prompt, shell or terminal, run ``pip`` to download and install
the PhasorPy library and all its dependencies from the Python Package Index::

$ python -m pip install -U phasorpy

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-36

Import phasorpy
---------------

Open the Python interpreter, import the ``phasorpy`` package, and check its
version:

.. code-block:: Python


    import phasorpy

    print(phasorpy.__version__)
