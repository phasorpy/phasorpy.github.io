Introduction to PhasorPy
========================

An introduction to using the PhasorPy library.

PhasorPy is an open-source Python library for the analysis of fluorescence
lifetime and hyperspectral images using the :doc:`/phasor_approach`.

Using the PhasorPy library requires familiarity with the phasor approach,
image processing, array programming, and Python.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 16-50

Install Python
--------------

An installation of Python version 3.10 or higher is required to use the
PhasorPy library.
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.
Python installers can be obtained from, for example,
`Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or
`Anaconda.com <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Refer to the `Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>`_
for an introduction to Python.

Install PhasorPy
----------------

To download and install the PhasorPy library and all its dependencies from
the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org/project/phasorpy/>`_ (PyPI),
run the following command on a command prompt, shell, or terminal::

    python -m pip install -U "phasorpy[all]"

.. note::
   The PhasorPy library is in its early stages of development
   and has not yet been released to PyPI.

The development version of PhasorPy can be installed instead from the
latest source code on GitHub. This requires a C compiler, such as
XCode, Visual Studio, or gcc, to be installed::

    python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/phasorpy/phasorpy.git

Update optional dependencies as needed::

    python -m pip install -U lfdfiles sdtfile ptufile

Import phasorpy
---------------

Start the Python interpreter, import the ``phasorpy`` package,
and print its version:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 57-62

Besides the PhasorPy library, the `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ libraries are used for
array computing and plotting throughout this tutorial:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-91

Read signal from file
---------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.io` module provides functions to read time-resolved
and hyperspectral image stacks and metadata from many file formats used
in microscopy, for example PicoQuant PTU, OME-TIFF, Zeiss LSM, and files
written by SimFCS software.
However, any other means that yields image stacks in numpy-array compatible
form can be used instead.
Image stacks, which may have any number of dimensions, are referred to as
``signal`` in the PhasorPy library.

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.datasets` module provides access to various sample
files. For example, an Imspector TIFF file from the
`FLUTE <https://zenodo.org/records/8046636>`_  project containing a
time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) histogram
of a zebrafish embryo at day 3, acquired at 80 MHz:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-98

.. code-block:: Python



    signal = tifffile.imread(fetch('Embryo.tif'))
    frequency = 80.11  # MHz; from the XML metadata in the file

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-123

Calculate phasor coordinates
----------------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.phasor` module provides functions to calculate,
calibrate, filter, and convert phasor coordinates.

Phasor coordinates are the real and imaginary components of the complex
numbers returned by a real forward Digital Fourier Transform (DFT)
of a signal at certain harmonics (multiples of the fundamental frequency),
normalized by the mean intensity (the zeroth harmonic).
Phasor coordinates are named ``real`` and ``imag`` in the PhasorPy library.
In literature and other software, they are also known as
:math:`G` and :math:`S` or :math:`a` and :math:`b` (as in :math:`a + bi`).

Phasor coordinates of the first harmonic are calculated from the signal,
a TCSPC histogram in this case.
The histogram samples are in the first dimension (`axis=0`):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 123-128

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.phasor import phasor_from_signal

    mean, real, imag = phasor_from_signal(signal, axis=0)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-132

The phasor coordinates are undefined if the mean intensity is zero.
In that case, the arrays contain special ``NaN`` (Not a Number) values,
which are ignored in further analysis:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-135

.. code-block:: Python


    print(real[:4, :4])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 136-137

Plot the calculated phasor coordinates:

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-146

By default, only the phasor coordinates at the first harmonic are calculated.
However, only when the phasor coordinates at all harmonics are considered
(including the mean intensity) is the signal completely described:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 146-158

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.phasor import phasor_to_signal

    phasor_all_harmonics = phasor_from_signal(signal, axis=0, harmonic='all')
    reconstructed_signal = phasor_to_signal(
        *phasor_all_harmonics, axis=0, samples=signal.shape[0]
    )

    numpy.testing.assert_allclose(
        numpy.nan_to_num(reconstructed_signal), signal, atol=1e-3
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 159-173

Calibrate phasor coordinates
----------------------------

The signals from time-resolved measurements are convoluted with an
instrument response function, causing the phasor-coordinates to be
phase-shifted and modulated (scaled) by unknown amounts.
The phasor coordinates must therefore be calibrated with coordinates
obtained from a reference standard of known lifetime, acquired with
the same instrument settings.

In this case, a homogeneous solution of Fluorescein with a lifetime of
4.2 ns was imaged.

Read the signal of the reference measurement from a file:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 173-176

.. code-block:: Python


    reference_signal = tifffile.imread(fetch('Fluorescein_Embryo.tif'))








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 177-178

Calculate phasor coordinates from the measured reference signal:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 178-183

The phasor coordinates are now located in the first quadrant, except for
some with low signal to noise level.

If necessary, the calibration can be undone/reversed using the
same reference:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 216-233

.. code-block:: Python


    uncalibrated_real, uncalibrated_imag = phasor_calibrate(
        real,
        imag,
        reference_real,
        reference_imag,
        frequency=frequency,
        lifetime=4.2,
        reverse=True,
    )

    numpy.testing.assert_allclose(
        (mean, uncalibrated_real, uncalibrated_imag),
        phasor_from_signal(signal, axis=0),
        atol=1e-3,
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 234-239

Filter phasor coordinates
-------------------------

Applying median filter to the calibrated phasor coordinates,
often multiple times, improves contrast and reduces noise:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 239-244

.. code-block:: Python


    from phasorpy.phasor import phasor_filter

    real, imag = phasor_filter(real, imag, method='median', size=3, repeat=2)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-269

Store phasor coordinates
------------------------

Phasor coordinates and select metadata can be exported to
`OME-TIFF <https://ome-model.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ome-tiff/>`_
formatted files, which are compatible with Bio-Formats and Fiji.

Write the calibrated and filtered phasor coordinates, and frequency to an
OME-TIFF file:

        harmonic=1,
        description=(
            'Phasor coordinates of a zebrafish embryo at day 3, '
            'calibrated, median-filtered, and thresholded.'
        ),
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 286-287

Read the phasor coordinates and metadata back from the OME-TIFF file:

    assert real_.attrs['frequency'] == frequency
    assert real_.attrs['harmonic'] == 1
    assert mean_.attrs['description'].startswith('Phasor coordinates of')

Plot phasor coordinates
-----------------------

The :py:mod:`phasorpy.plot` module provides functions and classes for
plotting phasor and polar coordinates.

Large number of phasor coordinates, such as obtained from imaging,
are commonly visualized as 2D histograms:

Phasor coordinates can be calculated from hyperspectral images (acquired
at many equidistant emission wavelengths) and processed in much the same
way as time-resolved signals. Calibration is not necessary.
